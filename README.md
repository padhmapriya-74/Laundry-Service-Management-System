# Laundry-Service-Management-System
This project is a web application that will help a small-scale laundry service provider to maintain their customer details.
It allows the user to create/view/update their customer details in the system. 
The system generates a transaction slip with a unique ID when a customer deposits clothes for laundering. 
The slip contains details such as type of each cloth, the type of laundry required, cost, and delivery date. 
The system internally allocates clothes to appropriate service points and collect back all the clothes belonging to a particular customer. 
A transaction is closed when a customer makes the payment and takes delivery of their clothes. 
The service provider should be able to generate daily reports.
Clothes are assigned to different service points depending on the workload and the status of each service point can be viewed anytime(queue data structure aided in this)
